                     <p>
                        With substantial investment in sensor development and platform deployment, the Remote Sensing (RS) industry has grown into a billion-dollar
                        global market, and is still on the verge of a massive growth spurt. An increasing number of government agencies, research institutions and 
                        commercial companies leverage the big RS data to advance climate change and environment monitoring applications. Nevertheless, 
                        the application of the big and ever-increasing RS data is bottlenecked by the limited ability of data processing techniques and software 
                        tools to effectively transform the data into value-added information, products and services. Therefore, the development of advanced AI 
                        and machine learning (ML) techniques that can effectively and efficiently derive meaningful information from RS data can greatly expand 
                        and enhance the applications of big RS data, improve the decision-making in climate change and environmental applications, 
                        enlarge the RS market with various new business models and customers, and create tremendous opportunities and growth for 
                        RS and geospatial industries.

                        In GSIL, we focus on the development 
                        of advanced AI & ML algorithms, models and systems for computer-aided processing and analysis of RS data to efficiently and 
                        effectively extract the weak, subtle and changing information from big complex RS data that can better support 
                        many environmental monitoring and climate change applications.

                        Hyperspectral imaging, which records the reflected radiation from the earth 
                        surface using hundreds of narrow spectral bands, can provide rich information 
                	for identifying and distinguishing spectrally-similar materials, and has 
                        become an essential tool leveraged by research scientists and operational users 
                        to retrieve key parameters (e.g., biochemical, biophysical and geochemical parameters) 
                        in various environmental monitoring and resource exploration applications. 
			  
                     </p>
		      <p>
                        Nevertheless, due to the large data volume, the innate high­-dimensionality, 
                        spatial­-spectral heterogeneities and the noise effect of hyperspectral image (HSI), 
                        there are significant challenges for users to efficiently and accurately transform 
                        HSI into value­-added information. To address these challenges, 
                        I and my HQPs have been developing novel ML, DL and spectral analysis models and methods 
                        for achieving computer­-aided processing and analysis of the large­-volume complex 
                        HSI that can significantly improve the quantification of valuable bio/geo-variables, 
                        and thereby improve environmental monitoring and resource exploration.

                              We develop novel DL/ML and spectral analysis models to improve many different HSI processing tasks, 
                              e.g., HSI classification, spectral unmixing, HSI denoising, feature extraction and visualization. 
                              We implement these algorithms into advanced HSI software tools to facilitate the development 
                              of data processing workflows, pipelines and analytic solutions to key HSI applications.
                              We use UAV/drone hyperspectral systems with Cubert UHD185 and Resonon Pika XC2 hyperspectral cameras to collect HSI on 
                              vegetated and industrial areas for vegetation monitoring and pollution investigation. 
                              We use the PRISMA satellite hyperspectral images for mineral and vegetation mapping. 
                              We develop data processing pipelines to improve the processing and analysis of UAV and satellite hyperspectral imaging data. 
                              We develop hyperspectral cameras based on the openHSI project https://openhsi.github.io/. 
                              We collaborate with Canadian industries, e.g., SkyWatch in Kitchener, to help them build intelligent analytics 
                              that can efficiently and accurately generate information products in crop mapping, mineral exploration 
                              and methane emission monitoring applications.  
                              We have been and will continue publishing on high-rank remote sensing journals and conferences,

                              Satelliet synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and airborne high-resolution optical images have been 
                              widely used in the monitoring of the Canadian water and Northern ice environment to support many 
                              critical applications, e.g., e.g., climate change studies, coastal environmental management, 
                              indigenous communities, and Arctic shipping route planning and navigation. Nevertheless, 
                              efficient extraction of sea/lake ice, oil spill and whale information from these images is 
                              difficult due to many challenges, such as large data volume, noise effects, the complex marine environment, 
                              and weak signatures of targets. To address these challenges, I and my HQPs have been using advanced ML 
                              and deep learning (DL) techniques to develop advanced image processing models and algorithms to better 
                              support sea/lake ice mapping, oil spills monitoring and whale detection.

                              For SAR sea/lake ice mapping, we develop advanced DL and image analysis algorithms for improving SAR image denoising,

                              for large-scale high-resolution daily Pan-Arctic SAR ice mapping. Our advanced AI algorithms enabled us to win the

                     <p>
                        LiDAR has been widely used to measure the structures, position and geometry of ground targets 
                        in many environmental applications. The processing and analysis of LiDAR 3D point cloud data, 
                        as a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, is critical to support these LiDAR applications. 
                        Deep neural network (DNN) models, due to their flexibility and strong feature learning capability, 
                        have been widely used for improving key 3D point cloud processing tasks. I and my HQPs have been 
                        exploring cutting-edge DNN models and methods for improving 3D point cloud processing and analysis 
                        in different LiDAR applications. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        I and my HQP develop novel hierarchical 3D Transformer Networks (3DCTN) to improve point cloud classification and segmentation. 
                        This work has led to a journal paper published in August 2022 on arXiv and IEEE Transactions on Intelligent 
                        Transportation Systems (IF: 9.551), and another paper submitted in Oct. 2023 to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (IF: 8.182). 
                        The above classification and segmentation models have enabled us to build a deep Transformer-based point cloud representation 
                        framework, to improve other key 3D point cloud processing tasks, i.e., object detection, 3D reconstruction, 
                        super-resolution and compression, towards building a complete toolbox for improving LiDAR 3D point cloud processing and analysis. 
                        This work has led to a highly-cited paper published on arXiv (also submitted to IEEE PAMI), and another paper submitted in Nov. 
                        2023 to Remote Sensing of Environment for tree species mapping with airborne multispectral LiDAR data. 
                        We will continue publishing on high-rank journals and conferences, and developing intelligent 
                        LiDAR analytics to improve environmental monitoring applications. We have been and will continue fusing 
                        LiDAR with multispectral and hyperspectral data to improve accuracy. Particularly, we will use the intelligent 
                        analytics to improve forest mapping and monitoring, to better support environmental impact evaluation, 
                        land management, and fire prevention planning in Canada.

                     <h3>AI-powered Wildfire Risk Prediction</h3>
                     <br/>

                     <p>
                        Supported by MITACS and BMO, this project aims to predict wildfire risk across Canada using 
                        AI and heterogeneous datasets, which is critical for environmental management and disaster mitigation.
                        By leveraging diverse data sources such as climate records, weather patterns, remote sensing data, 
                        and historical wildfire occurrences, AI algorithms can discern subtle spatial-temporal patterns and 
                        correlations, enabling more accurate and timely forecasts of wildfire outbreaks. This research aims 
                        to improve the current state-of-the-art predictive capability, such that it empowers wildfire management 
                        to minimize the devastating impact of wildfires on ecosystems, human settlements, and infrastructure.
